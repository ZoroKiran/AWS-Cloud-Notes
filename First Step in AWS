AWS provides free resources, some are always free, while some are free for a year. Rest of the cloud resources require some paymnet.
We can setup free tier billing alarm if in case we go beyond free tier provided resource consumption level.
We can search "aws free tier" - "aws.amazon.com/free"

You can create 1 year free account. You need to provide credit card detail so that amazon knows it is real person.

Choose "personl" if you are creating for yourself. In case, if you are creating for your company then choose "professional".

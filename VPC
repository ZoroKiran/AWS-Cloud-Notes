VPC is similar to a network. Inside the network, we have subnets where we can host the AWS resources like EC2.
Then you link the internet gateway to the VPC. In the route table we can write to allow in and out connection from /to VPC.
IPv4 CIDR Block: 192.168.0.0/16 this gives 65000 addresses. Here /16 is the CIDR block. This should also suffuce for 3-tier architecture.
IPv6 can be useful if we are going to have millions of IoT devices connected to the cloud. Otherwise, IPv4 is enough for regular corporate operation.

SG are at resource level, while NACLs are at Subnet level.
